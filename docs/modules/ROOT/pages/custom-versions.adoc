= Setting a Custom Version Number

Teak automatically uses the app store version number for your game. If you'd like
to specify the version manually, you can do so using the `Info.plist` on iOS and
resource XML on Android.

Versions are specified as a string, and are parsed as ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``.
If there is a missing component, Teak will assume it is zero. For example, if the
string specified is `"42"`, Teak will see this as `42.0.0`.

On iOS, add a string property named `TeakDeveloperVersion` to your Info.plist.

On Android, add a string named `io_teak_developer_version` to your XML string resources.
