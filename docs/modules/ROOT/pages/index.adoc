To follow this guide and get started with Teak, you'll need to prepare a few things:

* A Unity game with user authentication or device identification set up
* An https://developer.apple.com/[Apple Developer] account and https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[XCode] installation
* A https://app.teak.io/signup[Teak account]
* Basic familiarity with installing and customizing https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetWorkflow.html[assets in Unity], particularly https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingAssets.html[scripting with assets]
