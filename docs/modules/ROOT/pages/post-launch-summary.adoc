= Post Launch Summary

Each time your game launches, Teak will pass all of the information it has on the launch to you via the ``OnPostLaunchSummary`` event.

See <<TeakPostLaunchSummary>> for more details.

== Player Properties

Teak can store up to 16 numeric, and 16 string properties per player. These
properties can then be used for targeting.

You do not need to register the property in the Teak Dashboard prior to sending
them from your game, however you will need to register them in the Teak Dashboard
before using them in targeting.
