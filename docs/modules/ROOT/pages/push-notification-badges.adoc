= Badging Your App
:page-aliases: badging.adoc

You can set the badge count on your app's icon using:

doxygen2adoc:SetBadgeCount(int)[]

On Android, this functionality uses the https://github.com/leolin310148/ShortcutBadger[ShortcutBadger library by Leo Sin]. On Android,
badging may not function as expected depending on device. Not all manufacturers support providing a count with a badge. Additionally,
on all devices running Android 8+, the game must have a notification with an Opt-Out Category that has badging on Android enabled
in the device's notification center in order for a badge count to be set or updated.

On iOS `<<SetBadgeCount(int)>>[Teak.Instance.SetBadgeCount()]` requires that the player have granted notification permissions. If the player
has granted notification permissions, and has not revoked badging permissions from the Settings app, then `Teak.Instance.SetBadgeCount()` will
function at all times.
