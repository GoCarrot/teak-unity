There are several types of Push notifcations.

You can use Teak to schedule notifications for the future; delivered either to the current user, or other users.

NOTE: You get the full benefit of Teak's analytics, A/B testing, and Content Management System when using local notifications!

[IMPORTANT]
====
All notification related methods are coroutines. Unless you want the
method to block execution, you must use `StartCoroutine`.
