= Requesting Push Notification Permissions

In order to use push notifications on iOS, you will need to request permissions.

.Requesting Push Notification Permissions Using Unity's NotificationServices
[source]
----
UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationServices.RegisterForNotifications(
    UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationType.Alert |
    UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationType.Badge |
    UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationType.Sound);
----

If you do not wish to use this method, or its Unity Replacement, you can use a Teak method to get push permissions with Alert, Badge and Sound.

.Requesting Push Notification Permissions Using Teak
[source]
----
Teak.Instance.RegisterForNotifications();
----

NOTE: We suggest that you don't simply ask for push permissions when the app starts.
We'll be happy to talk with you to figure out what works best for your title.
