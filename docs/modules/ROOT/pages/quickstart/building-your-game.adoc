Just make sure the stuff gets signed. 

== Android

=== Initialize Teak in the `AndroidManifest.xml`

.Add this to the main activity in your AndroidManifest.xml
[source,xml]

<meta-data android:name="io.teak.sdk.initialize" android:value="true"/>

== Seeing Your Active User

If you've followed along so far, you can now go back to your Teak dashboard to see your active user.
