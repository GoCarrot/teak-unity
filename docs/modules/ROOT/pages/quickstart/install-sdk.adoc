== Add the Teak SDK

The easiest way to install Teak is using the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html[Unity Package Manager] and installing via git URL.

=== Installing via Git URL

In the Unity Editor select, menu:Window[Package Manager]. In the Package Manager panel, find the small dropdown menu in the top left corner. Select btn:[+] menu:&thinsp;[Add package from git URL...]

A text entry field will appear. Enter this git URL for the latest Teak SDK:

[,html]
----
https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git
----

Click the btn:[Add] button.

When all the progress bars finish, the Teak for Unity SDK is installed. You should now see *Teak* in the *Edit* menu of your Unity project. Next, we'll configure your build. +

=== Installing via Asset Menu

Alternatively, if you enjoy manually downloading files, you can download the https://sdks.teakcdn.com/unity/Teak.unitypackage[lastest SDK here], and import it using menu:Assets[Import Package > Custom Package...] in Unity.


== Configure Teak in Unity

Next, we need to copy our settings from your https://app.teak.io/[Teak Dashboard] and enter them in our Unity project. If you don't have an app in Teak, you need to create a new game.

* On your Teak Dashboard, navigate to menu:Settings[General].
* In the Unity Editor select menu:Edit[Teak] to open the Teak Settings in the Inspector.

NOTE: Make sure the Inspector tab is visible in your Unity window.

We'll be copying the _Teak App ID_, _Teak API Key_, and _ShortLink Domain_ into Unity.

<1> Copy your *Teak App ID* and *Teak API Key* from your Teak Settings and paste them into the same field in the Teak Settings in Unity.
+
These store the Teak App Id and API Key for use by Teakâ€™s runtime and helpers.

<2> If the *ShortLink Domain* is setup, copy the full URL and paste it into Unity. The blue copy button will copy the correct format.
+
https://docs.teak.io/usage/links.html[Short Links] are required for https://docs.teak.io/usage/rewards.html#_bundle_creation[rewarding] and https://docs.teak.io/usage/email.html[email]. The URL will be customer facing, so get it approved by marketing. You can add this later if you need to.

<3> The checkbox for *"Build Post-Processing"* should be checked.
+
This automates the native iOS and Android integration. If you need to disable this, you will need to manually manage and configure the xref:ios-dependencies.adoc[iOS dependencies] and the Android dependencies.

With everything configured, we're ready to add the required code.
