= Install the Teak SDK in Unity
:page-pagination:

It's time to open your game in the Unity Editor and install the Teak SDK. 

* [x] Teak supports `Unity 2020` or newer.
* [x] On Android, Teak requires the __External Dependency Manager for Unity__, which is installed with the xref:/quickstart/firebase-fcm.adoc[Firebase Unity SDK].

== Add the Teak SDK in the Unity Editor

The easiest way to install Teak is using the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html[Unity Package Manager] and installing via git URL.

=== Installing via Git URL

. In the Unity Editor select, menu:Window[Package Manager]. In the Package Manager panel, find the small dropdown menu in the top left corner. Select btn:[+] menu:&thinsp;[Add package from git URL...]
+
image:start/addpackage.png[Add package to Unity from git,width=256,role="related thumb"]

. Enter this git URL for the latest Teak SDK:
+
[,html]
----
https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git
----

. Click the btn:[Add] button. 

. When the progress bars finish, the Teak for Unity SDK is installed. You should now see *Teak* in the *Edit* menu of your Unity project. 
+
[NOTE]
If you are using **Assembly Definitions** in Unity you will also need to reference Teak's `.asmdef` file from your Assembly Definition Asset. See Unity's doc on https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html#reference-another-assembly[Referencing another assembly, window=_blank]. 

=== Installing via Asset Menu

Alternatively, you can download the **https://sdks.teakcdn.com/unity/Teak.unitypackage[lastest SDK here]**, and import it using menu:Assets[Import Package > Custom Package...] in the Unity Editor.


== Configure Teak in the Unity Editor

Next, we need to copy our settings from your https://app.teak.io/[Teak Dashboard] and enter them in our Unity project. If you don't have an app in Teak, you need to create a new game.

. On your Teak Dashboard, navigate to menu:Settings[General].
. In the Unity Editor select menu:Edit[Teak] to open the *Teak Settings* in the *Inspector*. (Note: Make sure the Inspector Tab is visible.)
+
We'll be copying the *_Teak App ID_*, *_Teak API Key_*, and *_ShortLink Domain_* into Unity.

&nbsp;

[start=3]
. Copy your *Teak App ID* and *Teak API Key* from your Teak Settings and paste them into the same field in the Teak Settings in Unity.
+
These store the Teak App Id and API Key for use by Teakâ€™s runtime and helpers.

. If the *ShortLink Domain* is setup, copy the full URL and paste it into Unity. The blue copy button will copy the correct format.
+
WARNING: https://docs.teak.io/usage/links.html[Short Links] are required for https://docs.teak.io/usage/rewards.html#_bundle_creation[rewarding] and https://docs.teak.io/usage/email.html[email]. The URL will be customer facing, so get it approved by marketing. You can add this later if you need to.

. The checkbox for *"Build Post-Processing"* should be checked.
+
This automates the native iOS and Android integration. If you need to disable this, you will need to manually manage and configure the xref:ios-dependencies.adoc[iOS dependencies] and the xref:android-dependencies.adoc[Android dependencies].

. The checkbox for *"Trace Logging"* should be checked during integration and testing.
+
This enables additional logging from the Teak SDK to the Unity Debug Log allowing you to quickly verify that Teak SDK calls are being made as expected.

== Initialize Teak on Android

There's an extra step to intialize Teak on Android.

[start=7]
. Add this to the **main activity** in your **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file. Firebase should have created an AndroidManifest.xml file, or you can https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/overriding-android-manifest.html[create one manually].
+
[source,xml]
----
<meta-data android:name="io.teak.sdk.initialize" android:value="true"/>
----
+
This uses Firebase's initialization of ContentProviders to auto-initialize Teak. If this step does not work for your game, please see the xref:android-dependencies.adoc#_initialize_teak[additional methods for initialization].

== Code Signing on iOS

[start=8]
. The `TeakNotificationService` and `TeakNotificationContent` targets will need to be signed on iOS. Xcode should take care of this when you sign the iOS-Unity target, but if you are getting provisionsing profile errors, check to make sure these targets are signed as well.
+
TIP: Setting up your **Signing Team ID** in Unity (menu:Edit[Project Settings, Player, iOS, Other Settings, Identification]) will sign everything automatically when you build for iOS.


The Teak SDK is now installed, we're ready to add Teak code to your game logic.
