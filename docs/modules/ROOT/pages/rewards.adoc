= Rewards

Whenever your game should grant a reward to a user Teak will let you know by sending
out an event to all listeners.

You can listen for that event during by first writing a listener function, for example:

.Example Reward Listener
[source]
----
void MyRewardListener(TeakReward reward)
{
    switch (reward.Status) {
        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.GrantReward: {
            // The user has been issued this reward by Teak
            foreach(KeyValuePair<string, object> entry in reward.Reward)
            {
                Debug.Log("[Teak Unity Cleanroom] OnReward -- Give the user " +
                    entry.Value + " instances of " + entry.Key);
            }
        }
        break;

        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.SelfClick: {
            // The user has attempted to claim a reward
            // from their own social post
        }
        break;

        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.AlreadyClicked: {
            // The user has already been issued this reward
        }
        break;

        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.TooManyClicks: {
            // The reward has already been claimed its
            // maximum number of times globally
        }
        break;

        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.ExceedMaxClicksForDay: {
            // The user has already claimed their maximum number of rewards
            // of this type for the day
        }
        break;

        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.Expired: {
            // This reward has expired and is no longer valid
        }
        break;

        case TeakReward.RewardStatus.InvalidPost: {
            // Teak does not recognize this reward id
        }
        break;
    }
}

And then adding it to the `Teak.Instance.OnReward` event during `Awake()` in any `MonoBehaviour`:

.Adding Listener to OnReward Event
[source]
----
void Awake()
{
    Teak.Instance.OnReward += MyRewardListener;
}
