= Unity Package Manager

Teak is available via UPM through a GitHub repo.

The repo uses a specific branch structure so that you can manage the Teak dependency
via git in the same way you would use other package management, to get
minor and patch version updates.

[NOTE]
====
If you see an error: ``"Expected 'resolvedPath' to have a value"``
then make sure the reference is "io.teak.unity.sdk" instead of a different value:

    {
      "dependencies": {
        "io.teak.unity.sdk": "https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git"
      }
    }

== The Latest Version

The latest version is always available at https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git

== How UPM Versions Work

The Teak SDK uses semantic versioning, which consists of:

    <major>.<minor>.<patch>

For example:: `4.3.0`

Major, breaking changes will happen only in major versions.

If new features are added, but no major breaking change has happened, it will be in a minor version.

If only bugs are fixed, or other changes occur in a non-breaking way, it will be a patch version.

For example: if you are using version 4.2.0 then you can update to version 4.2.1 and you should see no issues (except the bugs that got fixed, or performance improvements).

The version control structure for the Teak SDK, distributed via UPM, matches this and allows you to use the version that makes the most sense for you.

.If you use
[source, json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "io.teak.unity.sdk": "https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git#4.3.0"
  }
}
----

You will always use version `4.3.0`, even when new versions come out

.If you use
[source, json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "io.teak.unity.sdk": "https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git#4.3"
  }
}
----

You will use any version of `4.3.x`, so if `4.3.1` comes out, your dependency can be updated.

.If you use
[source, json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "io.teak.unity.sdk": "https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git#4"
  }
}
----

Then any version of the `4.x.x` series that releases will be eligible.

.If you use
[source, json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "io.teak.unity.sdk": "https://github.com/GoCarrot/upm-package-teak.git"
  }
}
----

Then any version of the SDK that releases will be eligible, including major version updates.
