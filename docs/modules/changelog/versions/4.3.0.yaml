upgrade_note:
- Deprecated `Teak.RegisterForNotifications()`. Instead use `Teak.RegisterForNotifications(System.Action)`, which will call the provided action once the user has allowed or denied push notifications.
- Deprecated `TeakNotification.ScheduleNotification`. Instead use `Teak.Notification.Schedule`. `Teak.Notifiction.Schedule` requires that the local notification be configured on the dashboard ahead of time, and supports per-call personalization.
