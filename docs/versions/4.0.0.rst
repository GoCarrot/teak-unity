4.0.0
-----
:Breaking Changes:
    * Minimum Unity version supported is now 2018.4.9f1
    * Moved the Android configuration values written by Teak from ``Assets/Plugins/Android/res/values`` to ``Assets/Plugins/Android/teak-values.androidlib/res/values``
    * ``support-v4`` support has been removed, AndroidX is now required
    * Firebase Job Dispatcher has been deprecated and removed, ``androidx.work:work-runtime:2.5.0`` is now required.
    * EventBus, ``org.greenrobot:eventbus:3.2.0`` is now required.
    * InstallReferrer version 2 is now required ``com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2+``
    * OpenIAB support removed. The project was abandoned 4 years ago.
    * Prime31 users: We no longer auto-detect Prime31 purchasing to attach the Teak listeners. This was causing problems in Unity builds which had Prime31 in a different assembly. You must now attach the listeners yourself:
        * ``Prime31.GoogleIABManager.purchaseFailedEvent += Teak.Instance.prime31PurchaseFailed;``
        * ``Prime31.GoogleIABManager.purchaseSucceededEvent += Teak.Instance.prime31PurchaseSucceded;``
    * Unity Purchasing users: Minimum Unity Purchasing version is now 3.1.0
